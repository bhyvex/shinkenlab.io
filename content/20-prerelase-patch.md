Hi,

We got a patch about the last bug we did have on the RC version on debian 7, it's time to test this new RC version so we can release the 2.0 :D

In the last RC dwe did have a bug on the `reactionner` daemon on the `debian 7` systems (maybe on others but we saw them on the debian 7 one). This bug was related to a low level bug on the python [multiprocessing lib](https://docs.python.org/2/library/multiprocessing.html) (that is used to manage worker process communication). If you saw such thing on your logs:


    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "/usr/bin/shinken-reactionner", line 97, in <module>
      daemon.main()

Then you got the `reactionner` bug. What is quite strange is that :

* it only hapen on the `reactionner` daemon, but `poller` and `reactionner` got the exact same code
* it's on the lower level of the `multiprocessing lib` (goot luck to catch this....)

The main difference between the reactionner and the poller daemons is that the reactionner have less activity than the poller. If it have very low activity, the worker process can kill themselve to get back some few Mb of memory to the system (was the `Harakiri` entries on the 1.4 logs).

In the [patch I propose this morning](https://github.com/naparuba/shinken/commit/d001d1f6fa7e5dcdb2cbb5590c9e341c49ee95e4) I did two changes:

* I remove the harakiri phase. The master daemon was launching new workers just after the previous one was killing itself, so it's was quite useless
* I switch the communication layer for the inter-process. It was based on `unix socket` (named pipe on the `/tmp` with numerous `pymp-` directories). I switch to a localhost tcp communicaton instead (random high port, so you don't need to touch your iptables rules ;) )

I think this will solve this case (no more call on this part of the code, and even if it does, this won't lead to the same bug). So please give a test. The bug did happen something like once a day, so if in 3 days we got no more crash like this, we will be OK for 2.0 release! :D

So please test it, I'l publish a `RC3` version on pypi (for the pip intall). All you will need to do is to launch:

    $ root@debian:  pip install shinken --update

And check your version with :

    $ root@debian:shinken --version
	shinken 2.0-RC3

Good test :D
