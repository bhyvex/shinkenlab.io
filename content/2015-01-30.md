Summary: The current shinken code is fully pep8 compliant :)




Hi :)

Just a small post about recent code enhancements. We are currently in refactoring mode, so we don't work on feature but mainly on code quality and such cleans :)

SebSolon and others folks from SavoirFaireLinux did a pep8/pizza night on the Shinken code base, and thanks [to them](https://github.com/naparuba/shinken/pull/1476) the Shinken code is now fully pep8 compliant :)

Now the pep8 compatibility is now integrated into the [automated tests](https://github.com/naparuba/shinken/blob/master/.travis.yml#L19) and so please take care about it when you send a pull request :)

This refactoring phase should be close soon, and then we will get back to feature coding ^^

From my part I did enhance a LOT my new [service discovery tool kunai](https://github.com/naparuba/kunai) during this period, and I'll post a first release note on the blog in the next week I think :)
