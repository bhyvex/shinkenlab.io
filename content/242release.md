Summary: Here is the 2.4.2 version :D




Hi :)


Here is a new maintenance version, the 2.4.2. Mainly about some bug fixes, and especially remove 2.2 version regressions.

We did prefer to postpone the 2.6 version (focus on large env) because we find that we still have regression since the 2.2 version and we think that we should get back to a rock solid version as the 2.0 version was, instead of sarting new things for 2.6.

We still having a bug sometimes with duplicated services with the livestatus modules, so there will be a 2.4.3 version in the futur I think :D

Like always you will find the release on [github](https://github.com/naparuba/shinken/releases)


See you soon and have a good monitoring :)
