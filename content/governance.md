Summary: The project now have a vision and governance text :)



Hi :)

Just a small post to let you know that now we have a vision and governance text now. This give us a clear and common view on where we are going and how code and contribution can be evaluated :)

I hope this will allow us to know on what to focus, what can be accepted in the project, and what can't be without hurting the whole project.

If I must reduce the governance into a single line, it will be that I'll always keep both the project but also the code accessible for its main users, the admins. It is what base the project and why is can answer to its users, so I'll keep it that way :)

You can have a look at the [vision and governance](https://github.com/naparuba/shinken/blob/master/Governance.md) file here :)

I'll also set the same governance on the kunai project ^^
